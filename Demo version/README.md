Azgaar's _Fantasy Map Generator_ demo, v. 0.52b. Based on [D3](https://d3js.org/) Voronoi diagram rendered to svg.

Project goal is a procedurally generated map for my *Medieval Dynasty* simulator. Map should be interactive, scalable, fast and plausible. There should be enought space to place at least 500 manors within 7 regions. The imagined area is about 200.000 km2.

Click on the arrow to open the Options. Click on *New map* to genarate a random map based on options setup. Check out [the project wiki](https://github.com/Azgaar/Fantasy-Map-Generator/wiki) for guidance.

This is a demo version, some new cool features are developed, but not yet deployed. Details are covered in my blog [Fantasy Maps for fun and glory](https://azgaar.wordpress.com). Comments and ideas are *highly* welcomed, kindly contact me [via email](mailto:maxganiev@yandex.ru). I would also like to see your completed or work in progress maps. For bug reports and change requests please use the main project [issues page](https://github.com/Azgaar/Fantasy-Map-Generator/issues).
