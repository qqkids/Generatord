# Fantasy Map Generator

Azgaar's _Fantasy Map Generator_. Based on [D3](https://d3js.org) Voronoi diagram rendered in svg. Please open a [raw version](http://bl.ocks.org/Azgaar/raw/b845ce22ea68090d43a4ecfb914f51bd) to be able to enlarge the map and pring it.

Project goal is a procedurally generated map for my *Medieval Dynasty* simulator. Map should be interactive, scalable, fast and plausible. There should be enought space to place at least 500 burgs within 7 countries. The imagined land area is about 1 million km<sup>2</sup>.

Please refer to [the project wiki](https://github.com/Azgaar/Fantasy-Map-Generator/wiki) for guidance. Links to an older versions are listed in the [changelog](https://github.com/Azgaar/Fantasy-Map-Generator/wiki/Changelog).

This is a demo version, some new cool features are developed, but not yet deployed. Some details are covered in my blog [_Fantasy Maps for fun and glory_](https://azgaar.wordpress.com), you may also keep an eye on my [devboard](https://trello.com/b/7x832DG4/fantasy-map-generator).
