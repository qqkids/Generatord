# Fantasy Map Generator

Azgaar's _Fantasy Map Generator_. Based on [D3](https://d3js.org) Voronoi diagram rendered in svg.

Project goal is a procedurally generated map for my *Medieval Dynasty* simulator. Map should be interactive, scalable, fast and plausible. There should be enough space to place at least 500 burgs within 7 countries. The imagined land area is about 1 million km<sup>2</sup>.
