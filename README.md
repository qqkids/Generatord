# Fantasy Map Generator

Azgaar's _Fantasy Map Generator_. Online tool generating maps based on [D3](https://d3js.org) Voronoi diagram rendered in svg.

Project goal is a procedurally generated map for my *Medieval Dynasty* simulator. Map should be interactive, scalable, fast and plausible. Initial intend was to place at least 500 burgs within 7 cultural areas and imagined land area about 1 million km<sup>2</sup>. As of now all these parameters are customizable and Generator is mostly used for a homebrew DnD campaign maps.
